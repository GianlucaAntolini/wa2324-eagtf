\subsection{Other Information}



To facilitate the initialization of the web app's database and fill in some starting data: we downloaded \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews}{Food.com - Recipes and Reviews} dataset, cleaned the data and adapted it to our database.\\
We finally created a script to insert the data about some test users (also with role "admin") and those recipes.\\
A guide on how to set up the databse is found in the "src/main/database/psql/set\_up\_guide.txt" file.
