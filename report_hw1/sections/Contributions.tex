	\item[Gianluca Antolini] Worked on the setup of the project, the creation of the database ER schema and the relative translation to SQL code. Created DAOs (also with Abstract DAO pattern) and some Servlets and JSPs. Worked on pages: login, create recipe, liked recipes and created recipes. Worked on report.
 	\item[Tommaso Bergamasco] Worked on the "Create Recipe" servlet and wrote the queries responsible for inserting new ingredients into the database.
	\item[Andrea Felline] Written (and fixed multiple times) the Python script for cleaning and formatting the CSV dataset of recipes. During this process, I ensured that the dataset adhered to PostgreSQL requirements for data formatting. 
    I developed the largest queries, such as searching for recipes based on ingredients and tags, suggesting recipes to compensate for empty or poor search results, and retrieving recipes along with their ingredients, creator information, and number of likes.
    Iâ€™ve written the About Us JSP page and servlet, as well as the JSP page, servlet, and DAO for displaying recipe details. 
    I also created the like REST service with the collaboration of Francesco Frigato.
