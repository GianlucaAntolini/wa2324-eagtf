\section{Main Functionalities}
The focal purpose of the website is to show recipes so all the main functionalities revolve around the creation and visualization of them.\\
Users can search recipes by inputting some ingredients and they will receive a list of recipes that are made using (also) those ingredients. There is also a list of similar recipes to the searched ones, a button to search a random recipe and finally a list of top liked recipes.\\
Users can in fact register and use their account to manage their informations, create recipes and like other recipes to always keep them at hand.\\
There is another type of account that is of type "admin" and that is the one responsible for approving/disapproving recipes created by users (when they create a recipe, they have to wait for it to be approved to be visible to other people) and eventually ban users who violate the guidelines.
